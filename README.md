# ObsercationalLearningAnalysis
This project aims to evaluate and improve the observational skills of medical professionals by analyzing their eye movements during medical procedures. By tracking key metrics such as fixation points and saccades, the project investigates how practitioners visually engage with critical aspects of surgical procedures and other medical tasks.

The goal is to identify patterns in gaze behavior that correlate with procedural accuracy, efficiency, and overall performance. Using advanced data analysis techniques and machine learning models, the project seeks to predict how observational skills impact decision-making, task completion, and the mastery of medical procedures. This research not only provides insights into how experienced professionals perform but also helps in developing targeted training programs to enhance the skills of less experienced practitioners, ultimately improving patient outcomes and surgical efficiency.

Key Tools and Technologies:
